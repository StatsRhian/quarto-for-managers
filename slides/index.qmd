- The data was wrong - can you re-run the analysis?
- Your manager loves it - can you do it for another region?
- Next month - do it all again.

## Template based-reports

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "1-8|6-8|2-3"

title: "NHS Workforce Statistics for `r params$ics_name`"
subtitle: "Data for `r params$month_year`"

## Interweave text and code 🧶

. . .

__Read in the data__

```{r}
filename = glue("NHS Workforce Statistics, {params$month_year} England and Organisation.xlsx")
```

. . .

 __Clean the data__

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "3"
staff_group = 
  staff_group |>
  filter(`ICS name` == params$ics_name) |>
  select(`Organisation name`, `Total`,
         `HCHS Doctors`, `Nurses & health visitors`,
         `Midwives`, `Ambulance staff`) 
```

. . . 

__Add insight__

```{r}
The table below shows the total number of doctors and nurses for each organisation within `r params$ics_name`. We can see that the organisation with the most midwives is the `r pull(max_midwives, "Organisation name")` with `r round(max_midwives$Midwives)` staff.
```

## Re-run next month

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "8"
