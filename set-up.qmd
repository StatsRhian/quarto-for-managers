You may need to wait a few moments for it to load. There are two exercise folders with quarto files for you to try editing and rendering.

 Thanks to [the Binder project](https://mybinder.org/) and [{holepunch} package](https://github.com/karthik/holepunch). My set-up files for binder are [on GitHub](https://github.com/StatsRhian/demo-quarto-for-managers).
